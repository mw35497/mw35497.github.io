							<p>In Summer 2019, I was employed as a Geophysics Research Intern at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA). My team outlined a predicament: surface GPS sites, with positions determined to high accuracy upon establishment, are assumed to remain stationary; In fact, tectonic plate velocities consistently exceed 15cm/yr at some locations. As it is costly to resurvey GPS sites frequently, how else might we keep the positional accuracy of GPS sites within the Agency's standard?</p>
							<p>My tools: a paper outlining a theoretical protocol which would identify the most accurate plate motion model for any location on Earth's continental crust, and a Python script which, when provided coordinates, identifies the most accurate plate motion model. I modulated the script into my own code such that plate motion data was collected over a global grid of over 1 million equidistant coordinate points. I then interpolated between the datapoints in ArcGIS. I delivered my team an interactive map depicting spatial variability in continental crust velocity, as predicted by plate motion models selected by the protocol.</p>
							<p>The Agency is now using my product to estimate the frequency of resurvey necessary to keep specific GPS sites within specifications.</p>
